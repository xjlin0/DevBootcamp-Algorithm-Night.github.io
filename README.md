Wanna to know more about whiteboarding for the tech interviews? Don't fight alone and feel frustrated, come to join us and discuss more. Let's practice together here, don't practice in your real job interviews.

## What is it?

A weekly workshop created to help DBC alumi/students practice their technical interview skills. The workshops are generally strucutred as follows:

**6:30-7:00:** Thunder talk on an algorithms topic.

**7:00-7:45:** Split up into groups of three. A new problem is displayed every 15 minutes. Each group member solves one problem while the other two group members act as interviewers.

**7:45-8:00:** Everyone gathers back together as a large group and discusses the questions.
